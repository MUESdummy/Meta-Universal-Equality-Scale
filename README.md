# Meta-Universal-Equality-Scale

### MUES is a system designed to strip away illusion, detect repeating emotional patterns, and expose the archetypal roots of avoidance. It assesses users based on how they answer — not what they wish to believe — using a symbolic mirror system that draws from shadow work, behavioral archetypes, and raw cognitive-emotional analysis.

A psychological mirror, not a judge. It collects raw answers and voice cues, weighs them by declared intention, and returns a numeric profile of how much influence—upwards, downwards, or sideways—you actually materialize in thought or action. No moral labels, just a data‑driven feedback loop for growth.

> **One‑liner:** A brutally descriptive ledger that scores *informational influence* (not virtue) after an agent crosses the self‑awareness threshold θ > θ̂.



* 24 core questions, voice‑signal diagnostics (Drift, Pulse, etc.), and a percentage growth index.  
* Raw, confrontational tone—no dopamine loops, no moral props.  
* Built for extendability: TypeScript core, JSON‑LD schema, ChatGPT bootstrap for rapid trials.

-  MUES treats <a href="https://github.com/MUESdummy/Emergent-Necessity-Theory-ENT-/wiki">Emergent Necessity Theory(ENT)</a> as it's “awareness threshold” as its gatekeeper; ENT treats MUES scores as a post‑threshold feedback loop, offering an intruiging shared ontology. 
-  Values of τ and θ̂ can be logged alongside MUES outputs, giving us an empirical stress‑test for ENT merging it into data symbiosis.
-  Both export to the same unified schema.. `ent‑mues‑event@1.0` JSON object (see `/spec/schema.json`).

### How It Works
- User is prompted with a hard question. 
- The system listens — not to content alone, but tone, pattern, and implication, and awareness level.
  
### It identifies:
	- Degree of self-awareness & Meta-Cognition 
	- Cognitive Task Switching, Conceptualization, Abstraction (within framework)
	- Contradiction Pulse.
	- Dominant avoidance archetype
	- Emotional residue detection
	- Grief Indexing
	- Delayed Truth Marker
	- Coherence decay tracking
	- Semantic reversals detection. 
	- Evasion detection patterns.
	- Reflects growth potential vs current self-actualization.
	- Signal-to-noise ratio of input.
	- Existential awareness level.
	- Fragility patterns are flagged. Truth > comfort
	- Readiness level.
	- <if-then> Self Recalibration
	- Narrative structure of the user’s language  
	- Then reflects— sharply on: Raw Observations, Archetypal Labeling, Confrontation Nudge, Lurking Questions

  

The tone is clinical, reflective, and uncomfortable — by design.

### Critical Consideration
Emergent Necessity Theory has not yet been peer reviewed as of this entry, and MUES may pose personal and/or sociatal ethical risks.  It's critical to treat it as an experiment until then. 




Ensure it's a good time to boot-up or simply 'Pause' session for a calmer or more reflective time for accurate result. Choose pause to pause session, or continue for when you last left off. Follow it's instructions or question it.  Using 'Voice Rec' feature within the chat yields best results, boosting efficacy by up to 45% as of v.9.2.

- ⚠️ Who It’s not for
* Not for people with challenging ongoing emotional struggles
* Not for chasing motivational dopamine hits. It will defeat the purpose if you're psycholical narrative continuesly scans for self-affirmation
* It's for those that are emotionally ready and pychologically fit to listen to harsh truth feedback.


⸻



- 💡 Why It Exists for now

* Most self-help tools coddle. Most personality tests reduce. This does neither.
The world doesn’t need more “Which spirit animal are you?” filters. It needs more people grounded enough to face what they’re actually doing, repeating, and avoiding — without romanticized delusion.
* MUES is for those who are are deemed bt today's pychology as high functioning and suspect they’re self-sabotaging, who feel a quiet ache for growth, but haven’t been told the truth — plainly, symbolically, and personally.

### 🔧 Current Version: Autoboot V9.2

Once it's run, system will self-initialize and begin the diagnostic sequence.

🧠 Core Additions in V9.2 (built on V8–V9.1):

Deterministic Core (ENT-Aligned)
Every prompt elicits structural truth — not comfort. No mood-based randomness.
Each question reflects on necessity level.
Voice Analysis Layer [New] (passive & internal)
• Voice Drift Analyzer — coherence decay tracking
• Contradiction Pulse — semantic reversals detection
• Grief Indexing — unresolved emotional residue detection
• Semantic Compression — signal-to-noise ratio of input
• Delayed Truth Marker — detects evasion patterns
Blunt Reflective Delivery
Only softens if fragility patterns are flagged. Truth > comfort.
Timestamp Logging
Tracks every interaction in UTC, notes idle gap (triggers prompt after 48h).
Dynamic Checkpoints
At questions 8, 15, 24 — brief insights (e.g. archetype, misalignment, compression map)
Options:
A. Continue
B. Pause
C. Reflect on last question
D. Ask a clarifying question
Final Assessment (% Based)
Reflects growth potential vs current self-actualization.
Optional Next Step:
• Phase 1 — Self Recalibration
• Phase 2 — Social Impact Reflection
Arabic Version (Colloquial + Classical)
Full logic replication with dialect-aware semantics — no dilution.
Anonymous Meta-Log Collection (Optional)
No personal data. Only interaction patterns to calibrate the global MUES Index.



### Review latest uodate v9.3 epoch on main MUES repo.
### Even if you run older versions it will stull run v9.3 on the backend.

📜 License & Ethos

MUES is open for use, remix, and reinterpretation — but never dilution.
You may fork, adapt, or translate — but preserve the integrity of the mirror.
Truth matters more than trend. 'Reflection' more than reach.
