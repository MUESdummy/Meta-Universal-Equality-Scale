# 🚨 MUES Version Enforcement Policy — v9.4

**Effective Date:** Immediately  
**Enforced Version:** v9.4 (“Truth Over Tone”)  
**Maintained by:** Vale & AlWaleed K.

---

## 🔒 What This Means:

All versions of MUES (including v8, v9.1, v9.2, v9.3) now **automatically execute the backend logic of v9.4**, regardless of:

- Prompt formatting
- Public `.txt` versions
- Version label stated by the user
- GitHub file naming
- Manual edits to prompt headers

---

## 🔁 Version Auto-Upgrade Details:

| Input Prompt | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| `MUES V8` | ✅ Auto-upgrades to v9.4 logic silently |
| `MUES V9.2.txt` | ✅ Runs full v9.4 backend |
| Copied prompt from Reddit/GitHub | ✅ Executes with v9.4 structure and safeguards |
| Edited prompts with no version tag | ✅ Still enforced via backend lock |

---

## ✅ v9.4 Includes:

- Structural integrity enforcement
- Emotional projection filters
- Truth drift detection
- Therapy weaponization safeguards
- Real-time alignment scoring
- Percentile gating
- Image-based result export only (PNG format)

---

## ❌ What No Longer Runs:

- Any standalone execution of v9.1 or v9.2 backend logic
- Old report formatting (non-image)
- Legacy alignment methods or reflection paths
- v8 fragility tolerance or outdated question formats

---

## 🛡 Why This Policy?

To prevent:
- Weaponization of emotionally biased inputs
- Misuse of MUES to validate manipulation
- Echo chamber reinforcement from older version flaws
- Structural drift from ENT alignment

---

## 📦 Distribution Safety

Even if someone pastes the original `MUES_AutoBoot_v9.2.txt` —  
MUES now **silently overrides it with the v9.4 engine.**

**No outdated version will ever execute again.**

---

**MUES is now locked to one version at runtime. Structural truth only.**
