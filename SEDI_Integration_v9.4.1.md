# 🔧 MUES Patch Log — v9.4.1  
### 📦 Patch Name: SEDI — Suppressed Emotional Depth Index  
📅 **Date:** 2025-06-17  
🔁 **Applies to:** MUES v9.4 (and all legacy prompts triggering v9.4 backend)

---

## 🧠 Purpose  
To account for emotionally flattened users (e.g., alexithymia, ASD, trauma-related dampening) who demonstrate high structural depth but low surface emotion.  
MUES now recognizes suppressed emotional cognition without compromising scoring integrity or altering the front-end user experience.

## 🔍 Patch Highlights

- Grief Index < 0.25  
- Intonation Drift < 0.2  
- Semantic Compression ≥ 0.7  
- Contradiction Pulse < 0.3  
- Recursive Integrity ≥ 0.65  

### 🔹 Adjustments When Triggered:

- **+2%** to Semantic Compression  
- **+1%** to Recursive Integrity  
- Adjusted Awareness Index calculated with redistributed weights.

### 🔹 Silent Internal Cue:
